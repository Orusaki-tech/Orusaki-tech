## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am I am an aspiring AI Engineer with entry-level full-stack web development skills and a passion for building data driven, AI powered applications deployed on Google Cloud. 
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Felbright Edu**(Private Repo). An EdTech platform to train CPA and ACCA enthusiasts to ace their examinations.
- ðŸ”­ I am also working on **PricePulse AI** (Private Repo), a hackathon winning USSD and Webapp to provide farmers with realtime market price information.(African farmers sell their produce for pennies. Let us help them get the best price).

- **My development process goes from gathering assumptions from the client. Conducting User Research to test those assumptions. My User Research develops the following products user empathy maps, user journeys, pain points, user personas and a value proposition among others. This allows me to develop functional and non-functional requirements. I then proceed to design the system. This is all an Agile process. This is a good starting point for me to translate the concepts to objects and classess and follow Domain Driven Design.**

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning AI Engineering with Huawei and AWS Udacity.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m also currently learning Domain Driven Design in C# and implementing design principles in C++ at the moment.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on backend, edtech, user research and AI/ML projects in NLP and Computer Vision
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Domain Driven Design, Clean Architecture, Deep Learning Architectures.
